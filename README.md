# About Me!
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Aaron, also known as @ShyTofu - I am a BSc Music Technology Graduate from Staffordshire University with an interest and love for everything technical.
I am currently working on furthering my understanding of HTML and CSS and learning more languages such as Python. 
I'm a content creator, resident high fantasy/magepunk geek and MMO enjoyer.
