# About Me!
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Aaron, also known as @ShyTofu - I am a BSc Music Technology Graduate from Staffordshire University with an interest and love for everything technical.
I am currently working on furthering my understanding of HTML and CSS and learning more languages such as Python. 
I'm a content creator, resident high fantasy/magepunk geek and MMO enjoyer.
<br>
## My Skills
- Proficiency in Logic Pro X, Pro Tools and Adobe Audition
- Skilled in playing Guitar, Bass and Drums
- Basic video editing (Adobe Premier & Sony Vegas)
- Beginner Python coding
- Computer & tech literate
- Detail oriented work ethic <br>
<h2>My Focus</h2> 
By weekday I am a trainee joiner, working with raw materials and creating bespoke, intricate and beautiful structures and fireplace beams. At night (and the weekends) I am a streamer on twitch, gamer and musician. 
My main focus during the freetime I do have is spent learning to code in Python and learning about the games industry in the hopes I'll be working within it someday soon. <br> 
<h2>Any Questions?</h2>
